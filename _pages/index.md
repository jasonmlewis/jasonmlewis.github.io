I am a researcher in the group of [Giovanni Volpe](https://softmatterlab.org/) in the [Department of Physics ](https://www.gu.se/en/physics) at the [University of Gothenburg](https://www.gu.se/en) in Sweden.

My research lies at the intersection of theoretical physics and machine learning, combining mathematical modelling techniques with numerical simulation to tackle novel problems in AI and the biological sciences.

My current work focuses on [decentralised](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_computing) [deep learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning), specifically the development of novel machine learning techniques used to [self-organise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-organization) and self-optimise a swarm of autonomous robots, which has subsequently been realised in a real-world robot swarm. 

I have worked in theoretical [soft matter physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_matter), particularly the computational modelling of [non-equilibrium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-equilibrium_thermodynamics) biological systems across all scales.

Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher in the group of [Joakim Stenhammar](https://www.stenhammargroup.com/) in the [Division of Physical Chemistry](https://www.physchem.lu.se/) at Lund University in Sweden. I worked on [active turbulence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_fluid#Active_turbulence) in suspensions of microswimmers, such as the bacteria _E. Coli_: [active matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_matter) at the microscale. This uses statistical modelling and numerical simulation via [HPC][idHPC] to investigate and characterise its non-linear [chemotactic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotaxis) behaviour.

I was awarded my PhD in 2019, completed under the supervision of [Matthew Turner](https://homepages.warwick.ac.uk/~phscz/), studying the dynamics of bird flocks, specifically under topological constraints: active matter at the macroscale. (Read my thesis here: "[Topological models of swarming](http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/133344/1/WRAP_Theses_Lewis_2018.pdf)")
